Lab 1 due February 2, 2022 

1. As I have very limited experience working with programming tools, most of the skills I learned in this first lab were new. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was able to follow along with the instructions provided to us, which made the process a lot smoother than what I expected. To begin with one challenging aspect for me was being able to position text on my webpage. For example, after creating a few practice headers and text to put on my webpage in GitHub’s markdown software, the text wasn’t quite placed where I wanted it to be. After re-positioning it a few times, I was able to figure out where they should be placed. Likewise, I would also like to work on creating text in software tools like Markdown and then transferring that to my page in GitHub (in relation to steps 9-11 of the lab). I was able to use Makdown to copy and paste the text I created in Word, and then transfer it to my page using the GitHub desktop. However, I will have to revisit how to download Macdown, as for some reason I was unable to download it due to some system error. Above all, I am happy with the progress I have made and proud of myself that I was able to complete almost all portions of this lab. I want to continue practicing creating posts on my webpage in the coming weeks as well, and to use time outside of class to familiarize myself more. The process of creating a webpage through GitHub has been so useful because my only previous experience with an online webpage was with WordPress, which although a great platform to use, already has everything ready for the user. Due to this limited experience, I am proud of how much I was able to accomplish in this first lab and look forward to learning more and enhancing my programming and technological skills in the coming weeks. I will admit that I need more practice in using Markdown, but overall, this first lab went a smoother than expected and gives me extra motivation to tackle future labs. 
2. I have two main goals for the semester: the first one is to learn more of the technical aspects behind the digital humanities. 
As I previously mentioned, I have very limited experience working with programming and different software tools in general, so I really want to take advantage of the practical knowledge this course offers me. 
Above all, I know these skills will be useful in my own dissertation writing, teaching, and future career. I can also use these skills to help teach future students and colleagues as well, 
which could be a mutually beneficial experience. My second goal is to push myself to consistently put forth my best effort, and to step out of my comfort zone. Specifically, 
this means doing my best to read, understand, and critically think about the class readings before class, to come prepared and fully participate during in-class discussions. I intend to maintain this goal by starting the readings early in the week to have ample time to complete them and review my notes before class. Likewise, as this course will teach me so many new skills, I will inevitably be pushed outside my comfort zone, whether this means working through a technological problem with calmness and a clear mind, or just being open to learning something new that may take time to master. Overall, I always want to maintain a positive attitude to take advantage of the opportunity this course provides us to learn new skills and gain more insight into the growing Digital Humanities field.

Lab 1 due February 2, 2022 

1. As I have very limited experience working with programming tools, most of the skills I learned in this first lab were new. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was able to follow along with the instructions provided to us, which made the process a lot smoother than what I expected. To begin with one challenging aspect for me was being able to position text on my webpage. For example, after creating a few practice headers and text to put on my webpage in GitHub’s markdown software, the text wasn’t quite placed where I wanted it to be. After re-positioning it a few times, I was able to figure out where they should be placed. Likewise, I would also like to work on creating text in software tools like Markdown and then transferring that to my page in GitHub (in relation to steps 9-11 of the lab). I was able to use Makdown to copy and paste the text I created in Word, and then transfer it to my page using the GitHub desktop. However, I will have to revisit how to download Macdown, as for some reason I was unable to download it due to some system error. Above all, I am happy with the progress I have made and proud of myself that I was able to complete almost all portions of this lab. I want to continue practicing creating posts on my webpage in the coming weeks as well, and to use time outside of class to familiarize myself more. The process of creating a webpage through GitHub has been so useful because my only previous experience with an online webpage was with WordPress, which although a great platform to use, already has everything ready for the user. Due to this limited experience, I am proud of how much I was able to accomplish in this first lab and look forward to learning more and enhancing my programming and technological skills in the coming weeks. I will admit that I need more practice in using Markdown, but overall, this first lab went a smoother than expected and gives me extra motivation to tackle future labs. 
2. I have two main goals for the semester: the first one is to learn more of the technical aspects behind the digital humanities. 
As I previously mentioned, I have very limited experience working with programming and different software tools in general, so I really want to take advantage of the practical knowledge this course offers me. 
Above all, I know these skills will be useful in my own dissertation writing, teaching, and future career. I can also use these skills to help teach future students and colleagues as well, 
which could be a mutually beneficial experience. My second goal is to push myself to consistently put forth my best effort, and to step out of my comfort zone. Specifically, 
this means doing my best to read, understand, and critically think about the class readings before class, to come prepared and fully participate during in-class discussions. I intend to maintain this goal by starting the readings early in the week to have ample time to complete them and review my notes before class. Likewise, as this course will teach me so many new skills, I will inevitably be pushed outside my comfort zone, whether this means working through a technological problem with calmness and a clear mind, or just being open to learning something new that may take time to master. Overall, I always want to maintain a positive attitude to take advantage of the opportunity this course provides us to learn new skills and gain more insight into the growing Digital Humanities field.

2) The Post45 HathiTrust dataset was interesting in that, once again, we were able to access a lot of different information about a certain topic to analyze in the pivot table. When I first entered the site, I was overwhelmed at first with all the information, but I found the site relatively easy to navigate and find information. However, there were certain categories I didn’t quite understand at first, such as the “juvenileprob” and “nonfictionprob,” but I was able to find out what the categories meant by selecting the question mark icon. This confirmed that we do not always know how to categorize data, and it may not always be accurate, but there is some transparency regarding this issue. Overall, I enjoyed exploring all the information on the site, although some of the categories left me wanting to know more, such as those with several “N/A” entries, I am interested to learn/explore more from this site. 
3) Data has the potential to show us amazing things about how our world currently and has historically operated. Specifically, data shown in charts or graphs, when done appropriately and objectively, can give us a visual sense of the magnitude of horrific historical events or current global crisis. This recalls two of the readings for this week, Chapter 5, “Unicorns, Janitors, Ninjas, Wizards, and Rock Stars” from Data Feminism, and “Why you should care about OCR” by Ryan Cordell. To begin with, chapter 5 in Data Feminism discusses the housing crisis in this country, specifically in places with increasingly high rent, such as San Francisco, and the burden this causes on working-class people to afford housing. The importance of collaboration and pluralism, as they put it, demonstrates how the digital humanities can help shape our conceptions of society and enact social change through working to show the disparities existent in our societies against historically marginalized communities; “A single data scientist wizard will never defeat the matrix of domination alone, no matter how powerful their spells might be. But a well-designed, data-driven, participatory process, one that centers the standpoints of those most marginalized, empowers project participants, and builds new relationships across lines of social difference—well, that might just have a chance” (last paragraph of page on website). Along the same note, in order to create this domino effect of social change through DH projects, there must also be a way to access written sources that may be both illegible and in multiple languages, which is where OCR comes in useful. 
The OCR tool allows data scientists and humanists alike to have access to materials that were not previously available to them electronically and can house a variety of texts in multiple languages. These texts now searchable through Google Books is a breakthrough for easier access to scholars globally (that is, if internet access is not a problem). The importance of these two texts in terms of our lab for this week shows both information that could be related to the OCR, in that a scholar could look objectively at the data provided in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, for example, and create a chart or table to study their findings. Then, they could use OCR sponsored search engines to find primary information regarding their findings that could relate to the journal of one of the captains of a voyage, which could very likely be written in other languages like Spanish, Portuguese, or French. The data shows the magnitude of the slave trade, in that you can see the numbers clearly presented before you. It’s easy to read something abstractly about the social and cultural consequences of this phenomena, but it is another, I would argue even more powerful tool, to visually see those numbers displayed. These numbers can also give us more insight. 
Specifically, the spreadsheet of the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade shows a variety of data categories, such as the number of voyages for each year, point of origin for the voyage, principal place of slave purchase, etc. Essentially, we can get a better sense of what was going on economically during this extensive period spanning nearly over the 16th-early 19th centuries. If for example, one year had a particularly high number of voyages, that could indicate some type of economic growth in Europe, to fund those trips. Likewise, if there was a downfall, especially towards the beginning of the 19th century, that reflects the independence uprisings in many Latin American countries, although slavery ended very late in some countries of the hemisphere, such as Brazil, in which slavery was only officially abolished in 1888. By integrating the pivot tables into the spreadsheet, using a combination of data categories, we can visually see these correlations between the places of disembarkation and frequency of voyages, destinations, etc. 
Although data should be objective as we discussed last week, there are circumstances in which the data really, “speaks for itself.” Such as in circumstances with the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade, data can be used to show historical circumstances and the magnitude of this very problematic endeavor that spanned over several centuries. Using OCR resources could be useful in gathering texts in other languages, as this directly relates to the history of the Americas and Caribbean, home to a plethora of language. Above all, DH scholars can approach this with the mindset of global change and awareness to marginalized communities, as addressed in Data Feminism.

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
